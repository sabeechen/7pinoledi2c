# 7 Pin OLED I2C Example
Example showing how to use and display a 7 pin monochrome OLED display in I2C mode, such as
 [IZOKEE 0.96'' I2C IIC SPI Serial 12864 128X64 Pixel OLED LCD Display](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076PP6WMW/).  I created this because documentation for the board doesn't exist and I ran into a lot of problems sorting it out.  See "oled_7_pin_demo.ino" for usage and instructions.
